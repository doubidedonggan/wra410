        <h2> Attendance </h2>
        <p>Attendance requires more than your physical presence. Come to class having done the readings and exercises so you are prepared to contribute to activities. We will spend the limited time we have together focused on deepening our understanding of key concepts and solving problems we encounter together. We will make extensive use of Internet resources and we will often shift attention from individual to group to class work. <b> Keep focused.</b>   </p>
        <p>You are allowed three unexcused absences. Every additional absence will subtract 50 points from your semester total.  If you see me in advance, absences maybe excused for sanctioned university activities or religious holidays.  Absences may be excused in the case of a medical emergency if a doctor's note is provided. </p>

        <h2> Late Work</h2>
        <p>No late work will be accepted without prior approval, with no exceptions.If you have an issue with a particular assignment, please contact me in advance to work out a solution.</p>

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Stealing and passing off as your own someone else&apos;s ideas or words, or using information from another&apos;s work without crediting the source, is called <i>plagiarism </i>. Some specific examples of actions that constitute plagiarism include pasting together uncredited information from the Internet or published sources, submitting an entire paper/project written by someone else, submitting a paper written for another class (and thus not original work), and copying another student&apos;s work (even with the student&apos;s permission)</p>

        <p>Students who plagiarize will receive a failing grade on the assignment and may fail the course. For specific MSU policies on academic honesty, see Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide (http://www.vps.msu.edu/SpLife/index.htm), especially General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades and the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades and Academic Honesty.</p>

        <h2> ADA </h2>
        <p>MSU&apos;s Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD) Students with disabilities that may interfere with completing your course work should contact the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities: http://www.rcpd.msu.edu/.</P>
        <p>MSU complies with all federal and state laws and regulations regarding discrimination, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). If you have a disability that could affect your performance in this class or that requires an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, please see me as soon as possible so that we can make appropriate arrangements.</p>

        <h2>Mandatory Reporting of Abuse</h2>
        <p> Limits to confidentiality. Essays, journals, and other materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student record policies. However, students should be aware that University employees, including instructors, may not be able to maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues to protect the health and safety of MSU community members and others.</p>
        <p>As the instructor, I must report the following information to other University offices (including the Department of Police and Public Safety) if you share it with me: Suspected child abuse/neglect, even if this maltreatment happened when you were a child; Allegations of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual harassment; and Credible threats of harm to oneself or to others.</P>
